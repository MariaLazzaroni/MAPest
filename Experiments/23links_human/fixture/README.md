This document briefly describes the process of producing the fixture. 
The robot sole profile has been obtained from CAD. 

The distance between the two robot feet (215.5 mm) during the homePosTwoFeetBalancing
position was computed using the getRobotFeetDistance script. 

The dimension (464 x 508 mm) of the AMTI Force Plate have been obtained from the website [1].

The distance between the two force plates (6mm) was measured with a caliber. 

The fixture is **NOT** considering the additional deptch given by the rubber 
around the forceplate and the different in height between the floor and the forceplate.

Distance between the iCub, the force plate and the feet silhoutte was sketched 
on paper during an experimental mockup.
